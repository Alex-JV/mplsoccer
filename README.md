# soccerplots

* **soccerplots** is a Python package that can be used for making visualizations for football analytics.

* The main aim of `soccerplots` is to save time for analysts so they can focus more on the analysis rather than coding the visualizations from scratch.
  
* The initial addition includes **Radar Charts**. The radar chart theme is inspired from [Statsbomb](https://twitter.com/StatsBomb).

* **soccerplots v0.0.2:**
  * Added feature to make comparison radar-chart, where you can compare players.
  
  * You can now pass fontname to the `plot_radar` function. Default fontstyle is 'Liberation Serif'.
  
  * Updated the way in which the radar chart is plotted. Previously, the module used to plot from right side(anticlockwise) now it has been updated it will plot from top side(clockwise).
  
  * Added credits at the end of the radar-chart. Credits given to [Statsbomb](https://twitter.com/StatsBomb).
